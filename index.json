Flood forecasting systems are based on models that require large volumes of data, such as rainfall forecasts, detailed measurements and high-resolution topography. However, flood forecasts are prone to uncertainty due to a lack of detailed measurements, and possible errors or oversimplifications in the models and/or data sets. Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites. This research is integrating this type of data on soil moisture and flood extent with rainfall and runoff models, which will lead to more accurate flood predictions. It will develop a remote sensing-aided methodology that can eventually enable forecasting models that predict the volume of water entering the river network to be applied anywhere in Australia.\n","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"f8f273020c3733f692087b48dfece9d8","permalink":"https://AshjWright88.github.io/project/floodforecasting/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/floodforecasting/","section":"project","summary":"Accurate flood predictions are critically important for limiting the damage caused by floods.

This study presents an analysis that considers errors arising from model input data, model structure, model parameters, and model states with the objective of finding a self-consistent set that includes hydrological models, model parameters, streamflow, remotely sensed (RS) soil moisture (SM), and rainfall. This methodology can be used by hydrologists to aid model and satellite selection. Taking advantage of model input data reduction and model inversion techniques, this study uses a previously developed methodology to estimate areal rainfall time series for the study catchment of Warwick, Australia, for multiple rainfall-runoff models. RS SM observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) satellites were assimilated into three different rainfall-runoff models using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Innovations resulting from the observed and predicted SM were analyzed for Gaussianity. The findings demonstrate that consistency between hydrological models, model parameters, streamflow, RS SM, and rainfall can be found. Joint estimation of rainfall time series and model parameters consistently improved streamflow simulations. For all models rainfall estimates are less than the observed rainfall, and rainfall estimates obtained using the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model are the most consistent with gauge-based observations. The SAC-SMA model simulates streamflow that is most consistent with observations. EnKF innovations obtained when SMOS RS SM observations were assimilated into the SAC-SMA model demonstrate consistency between SM products.","tags":["\"Ensembles\"","\"Hydrologic models\"","\"Kalman filters\"","\"Model evaluation/performance\"","\"Optimization\""],"title":"Identification of hydrologic models, optimized parameters, and rainfall inputs consistent with in situ streamflow and rainfall and remotely sensed soil moisture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashkan Shokri","Jeffrey P.

Thus, it is beneficial to find every possible behavioural parameter vector. This paper presents a new methodology, called the patient rule induction method for parameter estimation (PRIM-PE), to define where the behavioural parameter vectors are located in the parameter space. The PRIM-PE was used to discover all regions of the parameter space containing an acceptable model behaviour. This algorithm consists of an initial sampling procedure to generate a parameter sample that sufficiently represents the response surface with a uniform distribution within the “good-enough” region (i.e., performance better than a predefined threshold) and a rule induction component (PRIM), which is then used to define regions in the parameter space in which the acceptable parameter vectors are located. To investigate its ability in different situations, the methodology is evaluated using four test problems. The PRIM-PE sampling procedure was also compared against a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler known as the differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAMZS) algorithm. Finally, a spatially distributed hydrological model calibration problem with two settings (a three-parameter calibration problem and a 23-parameter calibration problem) was solved using the PRIM-PE algorithm. The results show that the PRIM-PE method captured the good-enough region in the parameter space successfully using 8 and 107 boxes for the three-parameter and 23-parameter problems, respectively. This good-enough region can be used in a global sensitivity analysis to provide a broad range of parameter vectors that produce acceptable model performance. Moreover, for a specific objective function and model structure, the size of the boxes can be used as a measure of equifinality.","tags":["\"PRIM-PE\"","\"equifinality\"","\"hydrological model\"","\"parameter estimation\"","\"uncertainty quantification\""],"title":"Application of the patient rule induction method to detect hydrologic model behavioural parameters and quantify uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashley J.

To provide accurate, precise, and timely flood forecasts, there is a need to understand the uncertainties associated within an entire rainfall time series, even when rainfall was not observed. The estimation of an entire rainfall time series and model parameter distributions from streamflow observations in complex dynamic catchments adds skill to current areal rainfall estimation methods, allows for the uncertainty of entire rainfall input time series to be considered when estimating model parameters, and provides the ability to improve rainfall estimates from poorly gauged catchments. Current methods to estimate entire rainfall time series from streamflow records are unable to adequately invert complex nonlinear hydrologic systems. This study aims to explore the use of wavelets in the estimation of rainfall time series from streamflow records. Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to reduce rainfall dimensionality for the catchment of Warwick, Queensland, Australia, it is shown that model parameter distributions and an entire rainfall time series can be estimated. Including rainfall in the estimation process improves streamflow simulations by a factor of up to 1.78. This is achieved while estimating an entire rainfall time series, inclusive of days when none was observed. It is shown that the choice of wavelet can have a considerable impact on the robustness of the inversion. Combining the use of a likelihood function that considers rainfall and streamflow errors with the use of the DWT as a model data reduction technique allows the joint inference of hydrologic model parameters along with rainfall.","tags":["\"Bayesian statistics\"","\"parameter estimation\"","\"rainfall retrieval\"","\"wavelet transform\""],"title":"Estimating rainfall time series and model parameter distributions using model data reduction and inversion techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashley Wright","Jeffrey P.

Data reduction techniques decrease the dimensionality of input data, thus allowing modern parameter estimation algorithms to more efficiently estimate errors associated with input uncertainty and model structure. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are used to reduce the dimensionality of observed rainfall time series for the 438 catchments in the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) data set. The rainfall time signals are then reconstructed and compared to the observed hyetographs using standard simulation performance summary metrics and descriptive statistics. The results convincingly demonstrate that the DWT is superior to the DCT in preserving and characterizing the observed rainfall data records. It is recommended that the DWT be used for model input data reduction in hydrology in preference over the DCT.","tags":[],"title":"A comparison of the discrete cosine and wavelet transforms for hydrologic model input data reduction","type":"publication"}]
