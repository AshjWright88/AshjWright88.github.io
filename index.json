To enable scheduling of energy supply for the next day I develop one day ahead forecasts. In my next post I will use this model to outline procedures to improve forecasting capability during uncertain times.\nWhen developing a model, it is easy to get carried away and build a fancy, shiny model which resembles a Formula One car. If we are wanting to go off road, then this model/car is next to useless. It is imperative to develop a fit for purpose model and track modeling improvements.\nThis blog will outline how I have:\n Tracked model development to ensure time is spent on measurable and valuable model improvements. Cleaned and explored the data. Developed a benchmark forecasting model. Developed a LSTM recurrent neural network to forecast electricity demand. Developed a MLP artificial neural network to forecast electricity demand.  Tracking Model Development Using the mean absolute percentage error, I demonstrate below one way that improvement can be tracked as model features are added and model complexity grows.\n  Model performance is greatest when the mean absolute percentage error reaches zero\nKey takeaway messages from tracking model development include:\n Both the MLP and LSTM outperform the benchmark model. Significant improvements are noticed when temperature data is included. Further improvements are realised when we account for the day of the week and holidays.  At this point it is essential to ask \u0026ldquo;will the end user benefit from further model development\u0026rdquo;?\nData Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis I now outline the process used to develop these models.\nModels are only ever as good as the data they are built on and the understanding of the key variables which cause a change in the observations.\nThis dataset was checked for:\n Missing data points. Outliers. General inconsistencies.  Now we can explore the data and look for hints that will help us construct an appropriate model.\n  Key takeaway messages from reviewing the decomposed electricity demand for Victoria include:\n From 2014 to 2018 there is a slight downward trend in electricity demand, this may be a result of electricity efficiency measures. There is a clear yearly seasonal component, this is likely to be a result of seasonal fluctuations in temperature and the subsequent heating and cooling demand. The residuals show that errors tend to peak at the beginning of the year.  Benchmark Model Upon reviewing Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods we can see that exponential smoothing models commonly outperformed other statistical and machine learning models. Well suited to model seasonality and trend we use the Holt - Winters triple exponential smoother as our benchmark.\n  Key takeaway messages from reviewing the benchmark model:\n The benchmark model captures the annual seasonality. Residuals in training still show errors peaking at the start of the year. The residuals in development show a weekly pattern which is potentially a result of lower electricity demand on the weekend.  Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network The LSTM RNN is a popular choice for time series forecasting. This model learns from the past 7 days of electricity demand, minimum, maximum, and average temperature, and solar radiation. It is assumed that we will have a good estimate of the next day\u0026rsquo;s weather.\n  The key takeaway messages from reviewing LSTM model performance are:\n The LSTM significantly out-performs the benchmark model capturing peak demand much better. The residuals in training show that there is a pattern to the errors. These peaks are likely to be around holiday periods. The residuals in development still show a weekly pattern. This is likely to be a result of lower electricity demand on the weekend.  Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network Instead of perceiving electricity demand as a time series model we can treat the model as a function of the past 7 days for weather, day of the week and year, and holiday period. The MLP ANN is well suited to this task.\n  The key takeaway messages from reviewing MLP model performance are:\n Including days of the year which account for behavioral changes commonly associated with changes to electricity demand significantly improves performance. The model tends to both under and over-predict peaks and troughs. An alternate loss function may help this. Since behaviour is a key element to electricity demand forecasting, we can expect electricity demand during the pandemic to be more difficult to forecast.  Summary In this blog post I provided an overview of one way to develop a benchmark model and use it to track improvements made by other models. Following this procedure allows end users to follow to model development process and identify shortcomings and priorities. It is shown that the MLP ANN which accounts for the day of the week and holidays significantly outperforms the LSTM and benchmark model.\nYou may have noticed that I did not test the model using Victorian electricity demand data for 2019 onward. Preventing test data from being used in model development enables us to make more reliable forecasts. Next week I will outline procedures to improve forecasting capability during uncertain times.\n","date":1601856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601856000,"objectID":"066149478f8d61bc56b0499f8b34b504","permalink":"https://AshjWright88.github.io/post/energy-consumption-pandemic-part-b/","publishdate":"2020-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/energy-consumption-pandemic-part-b/","section":"post","summary":"Model Development Using the daily Victorian electricity demand as an example, this blog will outline procedures to develop a forecasting model.

We have seen economies free fall, toilet paper being hoarded, and unprecedented amounts of data made publicly available. To say that pivot has emerged as a buzzword is an understatement. How then should we decide which direction to pivot in? Let us see what we can learn from the data.\nThis weekly blog will deliver insights into:\n The observed changes in electricity demand during the pandemic. What impact changed habits have on forecasting capability. The value to be gained.  As a starting point we will profile the typical weekday and weekend electricity demand and reference price for Victorian\u0026rsquo;s during the current stage 4 restrictions. To gain further insight into the potential impact stage 4 restrictions have on electricity demand and price, we will make comparisons for the same time period last year in Victoria and similarly New South Wales, a state which is not currently under stage 4 restrictions.\nVictorian Electricity demand profiles during stage 4 restrictions Fluctuations in Electricity demand are predominantly influenced by human behaviour and the demand for heating and cooling. Typically, when comparing electricity demand across years and seasons, demand data is normalized by the weather. It is not pragmatic to normalise the 30 min electricity demand data, made available through AEMO, by the daily temperature observations made available through the BoM. Consequently, we will compare electricity demand data without factoring in heating and cooling requirements.\n  Key takeaway messages from reviewing Victorian electricity demand data include:\n Our weekends are looking less regular. Midday demand is flatter on weekends. Weekend electricity demand shows more variation, particularly during stage 4 restrictions between 7 AM and 3PM.  New South Wales electricity demand profiles during Victoria\u0026rsquo;s stage 4 restrictions Naturally, I was then curious to compare the Victorian electricity demand profiles to those found in a state which does not currently have stage 4 restrictions in place. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the neighbouring state of NSW.\n  Key takeaway messages from reviewing NSW electricity demand data include:\n There are less changes changes in midday demand on the weekends. Less restrictions in NSW may be associated with more consistency in electricity demand. Aggregated electricity demand across NSW and Victoria has not significantly changed. This was not expected. It is quite possible that increases in residential demand are offsetting decreases in commercial demand. It would be great to get access to this data!  Victorian electricity price profiles during Victoria\u0026rsquo;s stage 4 restrictions If you are like me and ask, \u0026ldquo;if residential electricity demand has increased then will my electricity bill be through the roof?\u0026rdquo; The answer is it depends. The key variables are the electricity tariffs you pay (explore the Victorian energy compare website for more information) and the regional reference price (RRP) which reflects the price to supply electricity to a region.\n  Key takeaway messages from reviewing Victorian RRP data include:\n There has been a significant shift in RRP since last year. There is no longer a morning peak in RRP. There are currently less fluctuations in RRP throughout the day.  New South Wales electricity price profiles during Victoria\u0026rsquo;s stage 4 restrictions Again, we should compare this to New South Wales to see if the trend is specific to Victoria.\n  After reviewing the NSW RRP data, it is clear that the decline in RRP is not specific to Victoria.\nHow Australia\u0026rsquo;s Regional Reference Prices have changed over the years The next step is to compare the average RRP for electricity in each state for each year to the current date of analysis.\n  The key takeaway messages from reviewing state by state RRP include:\n RRP is at a 5-year low. Electricity RRP is heavily influenced by LNG which is in turn influenced by the price of oil. For the interested reader please refer here for more information. COVID-19 is not the only reason electricity prices are at 5 year low, there are a number of other important factors to consider.  Summary When compared to this time last year, weekend electricity demand under the current restrictions is less regular for Victoria. COVID-19, among other factors, has driven the regional reference price for electricity to a 5 year low.\n2020 has been a year of uncertainty and the need for good quality forecasts has increased. Prior to making any predictions about the future it is imperative that the data is explored and key drivers for change are understood. Even then, unprecedented changes make forecasting even more difficult. Future posts may look into household demand and/or the influence oil price has on RRP.\n","date":1601251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601251200,"objectID":"3ee91b2f9cc6d591edd0af6c2372e2b1","permalink":"https://AshjWright88.github.io/post/energy-consumption-pandemic-part-a/","publishdate":"2020-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/energy-consumption-pandemic-part-a/","section":"post","summary":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our understanding of uncertainty and what exactly normal is.

This study presents an analysis that considers errors arising from model input data, model structure, model parameters, and model states with the objective of finding a self-consistent set that includes hydrological models, model parameters, streamflow, remotely sensed (RS) soil moisture (SM), and rainfall. This methodology can be used by hydrologists to aid model and satellite selection. Taking advantage of model input data reduction and model inversion techniques, this study uses a previously developed methodology to estimate areal rainfall time series for the study catchment of Warwick, Australia, for multiple rainfall-runoff models. RS SM observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) satellites were assimilated into three different rainfall-runoff models using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Innovations resulting from the observed and predicted SM were analyzed for Gaussianity. The findings demonstrate that consistency between hydrological models, model parameters, streamflow, RS SM, and rainfall can be found. Joint estimation of rainfall time series and model parameters consistently improved streamflow simulations. For all models rainfall estimates are less than the observed rainfall, and rainfall estimates obtained using the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model are the most consistent with gauge-based observations. The SAC-SMA model simulates streamflow that is most consistent with observations. EnKF innovations obtained when SMOS RS SM observations were assimilated into the SAC-SMA model demonstrate consistency between SM products.","tags":["\"Ensembles\"","\"Hydrologic models\"","\"Kalman filters\"","\"Model evaluation/performance\"","\"Optimization\""],"title":"Identification of hydrologic models, optimized parameters, and rainfall inputs consistent with in situ streamflow and rainfall and remotely sensed soil moisture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashkan Shokri","Jeffrey P.

Thus, it is beneficial to find every possible behavioural parameter vector. This paper presents a new methodology, called the patient rule induction method for parameter estimation (PRIM-PE), to define where the behavioural parameter vectors are located in the parameter space. The PRIM-PE was used to discover all regions of the parameter space containing an acceptable model behaviour. This algorithm consists of an initial sampling procedure to generate a parameter sample that sufficiently represents the response surface with a uniform distribution within the “good-enough” region (i.e., performance better than a predefined threshold) and a rule induction component (PRIM), which is then used to define regions in the parameter space in which the acceptable parameter vectors are located. To investigate its ability in different situations, the methodology is evaluated using four test problems. The PRIM-PE sampling procedure was also compared against a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler known as the differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAMZS) algorithm. Finally, a spatially distributed hydrological model calibration problem with two settings (a three-parameter calibration problem and a 23-parameter calibration problem) was solved using the PRIM-PE algorithm. The results show that the PRIM-PE method captured the good-enough region in the parameter space successfully using 8 and 107 boxes for the three-parameter and 23-parameter problems, respectively. This good-enough region can be used in a global sensitivity analysis to provide a broad range of parameter vectors that produce acceptable model performance. Moreover, for a specific objective function and model structure, the size of the boxes can be used as a measure of equifinality.","tags":["\"PRIM-PE\"","\"equifinality\"","\"hydrological model\"","\"parameter estimation\"","\"uncertainty quantification\""],"title":"Application of the patient rule induction method to detect hydrologic model behavioural parameters and quantify uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashley J.

To provide accurate, precise, and timely flood forecasts, there is a need to understand the uncertainties associated within an entire rainfall time series, even when rainfall was not observed. The estimation of an entire rainfall time series and model parameter distributions from streamflow observations in complex dynamic catchments adds skill to current areal rainfall estimation methods, allows for the uncertainty of entire rainfall input time series to be considered when estimating model parameters, and provides the ability to improve rainfall estimates from poorly gauged catchments. Current methods to estimate entire rainfall time series from streamflow records are unable to adequately invert complex nonlinear hydrologic systems. This study aims to explore the use of wavelets in the estimation of rainfall time series from streamflow records. Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to reduce rainfall dimensionality for the catchment of Warwick, Queensland, Australia, it is shown that model parameter distributions and an entire rainfall time series can be estimated. Including rainfall in the estimation process improves streamflow simulations by a factor of up to 1.78. This is achieved while estimating an entire rainfall time series, inclusive of days when none was observed. It is shown that the choice of wavelet can have a considerable impact on the robustness of the inversion. Combining the use of a likelihood function that considers rainfall and streamflow errors with the use of the DWT as a model data reduction technique allows the joint inference of hydrologic model parameters along with rainfall.","tags":["\"Bayesian statistics\"","\"parameter estimation\"","\"rainfall retrieval\"","\"wavelet transform\""],"title":"Estimating rainfall time series and model parameter distributions using model data reduction and inversion techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashley Wright","Jeffrey P.
